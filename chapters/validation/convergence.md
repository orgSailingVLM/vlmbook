# Convergence

pySailingVLM software allows user to specify the number of panels in a spanwise and chordwise direction. The more panels are used during computations, the more precise solution will be obtained. Below the rc44 example is used to show the total force per sail (Course over Ground) convergance.

According to generated graphs, total force per sail (for all axises) converges to a certain value as the number of panels increases.
