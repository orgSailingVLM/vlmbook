# Sweep wing

The swept wing by Bertin {cite}`bertin`, is a flat plate with a $45^\circ$ sweep angle.
The span of wing is 1 unit and the chord is 0.2 unit.
The model was discretised into 4 spanwise panels and 1 chordwise panel.
The free stream is aligned with the x-axis and its magnitude is 1 unit.
