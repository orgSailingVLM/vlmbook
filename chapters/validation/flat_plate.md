# Rectangular flat plate

Using pySailingVLm a rectangular flat plate was modeled with a span of 10 units and a constant chord of 1 unit.
The geomery of sail is discretized into 16 spanwise and 8 chordwise panels.
The free-stream strength is 1 unit and the angle of attack is $10^\circ$.
Then the lift coefficient slope $C_{L,\alpha}$ was compared with {cite}`mgr` and analitically derived results (using equation {eq}`anal`) in the table below.

```{math}
:label: anal
C_{L,\alpha} = \frac{2\pi}{1+ \frac{2}{e_w AR}}
```

where:
AR - aspect ratio
$e_w$ - span efficiency factor

## Results

The results obtained by pySailingVLM are aligned with analitical formula and numerical data {cite}`mgr`.
The analytically derived results assumes the span efficiency factor of 0.8.
