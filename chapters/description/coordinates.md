#  Coordinate System and Wind

The surface of the geometry used is defined with coordinates in three dimensions (figure {numref}`{number} <geoms>`)  with the x-axis in the yachts longitudinal (chordwise) direction positive backwards, the y-axis in the transverse direction positive to starboard and the z-axis in spanwise direction positive upwards.

A boat moves along x-axis with the $\overrightarrow{V}_{yacht}$ velocity (figure {numref}`{number} <coord_sys>`). The speed of yacht  measured directly from the sailor point of view is desscribed by vectors $\overrightarrow{V}_{app\_wind\_infs}$ (without induced wind velocity $\overrightarrow{w}$ ) and $\overrightarrow{V}_{app\_wind_\fs}$ (with induced wind velocity). An aerodynamic force is generated and is  perpendicular to the apparent wind velocity. The profile of apparent wind is twisted (see figure {numref}`{number} <north>`).

It is worth adding that the induced wind causes extra drag (see figure {numref}`{number} <induced_drag>`)
