# Conclusions

pySailingVLM package created for initial aerodynamic analysis of upwind sails can be useful in 
early conceptual phase, when many different desings should be tested. Numba with 'non-objective' pySailingVLM code gives satisfying acceleration results in comparison to objective code. Data generated by this package is close to theory and other tools {cite}`mgr`. It has light weight requirements and can be run locally or in a cloud environment such as Google Collab. Apart from this, users can define own sail geometries and visualize obtained results.
