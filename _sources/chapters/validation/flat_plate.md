# Rectangular flat plate
Using pySailingVLm a rectangular flat plate was modeled with a span of 10 units and a constant chord of 1 unit. The geomery of sail is discretized into 16 spanwise and 8 chordwise panels. The free-stream strength is 1 unit and the angle of attack is $10^\circ$. Then the results was compared with {cite}`mgr` and analitically derived results in the table below.

## results
pySailingVLM gives very similar results in comparison to {cite}`mgr` and analitically derived results.
