# Falkner 

In order to validate pySailingVLm software, comparison between swept and unswept rectangluar wings were done (according to Fig. 4 from {cite}`katz_article`).
Theoretical data was taken from {cite}`falkner` (table 25, 26 and 28) with following assumptions: aspect ratio equal to 2, 126-vortex solution, 0, 30 and 45 degree sweep angle.

Comparison between swept and unswept rectangluar wings. Figure generated by author.
```

The lift coefficient slope for calculated wings and spanwise lift distributions calculated by pySailingVLM are aligned with Falkner's results.
