# Rectangular flat plate
Using pySailingVLm a rectangular flat plate was modeled with a span of 10 units and a constant chord of 1 unit. The geomery of sail is discretized into 16 spanwise and 8 chordwise panels. The free-stream strength is 1 unit and the angle of attack is $10^\circ$. Then the lift coefficient slope  $C_{L,\alpha}$ was compared with {cite}`mgr` and analitically derived results in the table below.

## results

The results obtained by pySailingVLM are close to analitical and also {cite}`mgr` data. It should be noticed that analytically derived results assumes a span efficiency factor of 0.8.
